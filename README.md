Incompletion note

I struggled to complete the assignment due to the difficult balance of work and school responsibilities, which left me with limited time and energy. Furthermore, I've been dealing with mental health issues that have made it hard for me to concentrate and manage my time effectively. Despite my best efforts, these factors made it difficult for me to complete the assignment as intended.

In terms of Laravel, I think it's a powerful framework that simplifies many aspects of web development, especially with its built-in features for routing, authentication, and database management. However, I wish I had more time to explore advanced topics like API development, middleware, and testing within Laravel. Covering these areas would have helped me deepen my understanding and create more robust applications.
